# Sendy-Logistic-Challenge
Our main objective is to build a model that predict the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at final destination.  The solution will help Sendy enhance customer communication and improve the reliability of its service; which will ultimately improve customer experience. In addition, the solution will enable Sendy to realise cost savings, and ultimately reduce the cost of doing business, through improved resource management and planning for order scheduling.
